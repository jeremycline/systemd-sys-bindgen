# Rust FFI bindings to libsystemd

This is just an educational project at the moment. It does not provide a Rust
interface to libsystemd, just the FFI generated by bindgen.

# Building

Get the bindgen
[requirements](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)
installed, along with the systemd headers (systemd-devel on Fedora).
